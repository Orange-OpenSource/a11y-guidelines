# WCAG criteria by theme

This base criteria for the Orange websites and applications avoids the major accessibility errors. It is a subset of the accessibility requirements.   
Its implementation does not give you the guarantee to be 100% accessible, but is a clean bedrock so you can engage in a progressive accessibility implementation process.

Following the Orange guidelines (<cite>Design for digital platforms Guidelines</cite>), available on the [Orange brand site](http://design.orange.com/) is a prerequisite to the use of this base criteria. 
Some elements already present in the Orange Brand (such as the use of colours, text alignment...) have not been included in this list of criteria.

Two versions are available:
- **The first version** does not mention the code, it is aimed at product designers, designers, project managers, etc.
- **The second version** mentions the code and is aimed at developers, technical managers, validation teams, testers, etc.
