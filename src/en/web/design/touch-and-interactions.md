# Touch and interactions

<p class="lead">Ensure that the user keeps control over interactions, particularly tactile ones</p>




## Offer an alternative to complex gestures

**Target:** everyone in particular, people with motor or visual disability and mobility.  
**When** during design and development.

**Description:**  
For each complex gestural interaction, an alternative must be available (for example a non-gestural or simplified alternative).
Similarly for interactions requiring a change of orientation of the screen (tilting, rotation, shaking ...).

**Complex gesture:** any multi-pointer gesture (requiring several fingers), and / or path-bases gesture.  
**Simplified gesture:** an alternative requiring a single pointer (one finger) without path-based gesture.




## Give access to the content regardless of the orientation of the screen

**Target:** Everyone in particular, people with motor or visual disability and mobility.   
**When:** during design and development.

**Description:**  
Access to the content must not depend on the orientation of the screen (portrait and landscape) unless a specific display orientation is essential (e.g. serious game).
