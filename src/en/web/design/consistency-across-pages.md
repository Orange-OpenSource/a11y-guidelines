# Identify and maintain consistency of groupings and different regions of the page

**Target:** Everyone, especially people with visual, cognitive or attention deficit disorders.

**When:** when designing.

**Description:**  
Provide ways to identify and visually distinguish the different parts of the page and ensure the consistency of these regions or groupings in all pages.

**Checklist:**

- Make sure that the navigation mechanisms are always located at the same place in a set of pages.
- Ensure that the components and groupings that have the same function, are identified (visually) in the same way and, as far as possible, respect the classic appearance of these elements so as not to disturb the user accustomed to a specific aspect of them (for example, links are usually underlined ...).
- Ensure that the areas of the page are clearly delimited (borders, edges, sufficient contrast ...) or that there is a way to visually distinguish the groups (sub-menu, drop-down list ...) as well as the different regions of the page.

**Do:**

Here, the tooltip (tooltip) is delimited by a visible border and sufficiently contrasted, to identify its content.

**Don't:**

It is very difficult to associate the themes ("par region", "par genre"...) and the sub-themes in columns, especially since the horizontal borders are not enough contrasted.
