# Offer an alternative to complex gestures

**Target: ** everyone in particular, people with motor or visual disability and mobility.  
**When & nbsp;: ** during design and development.

**Description: **  
For each complex gestural interaction, an alternative must be available (for example a non-gestural or simplified alternative).
Similarly for interactions requiring a change of orientation of the screen (tilting, rotation, shaking ...).

**Complex gesture:** any multi-pointer gesture (requiring several fingers), and / or path-bases gesture.  
**Simplified gesture:** an alternative requiring a single pointer (one finger) without path-based gesture.
