# Allowing control of animations

**Target:** people with visual impairments, reading/attention/understanding difficulties and seizure disorders.  
**When:** when designing the service and during graphic design.

**Description:**  
All moving, refreshed or flashing content must provide a way to be stopped, paused or hidden by the user, i^f this animation last more than 5 seconds.
Also, avoid as much as possible flashing content and sudden brightness changes (see [The logo of the Olympics causes seizures](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/6724245.stm)).

**Example:**

A carousel that automatically scrolls must be paused when the mouse is over it or when it receives the focus.
It is also possible to add a “pause” button directly in the interface.
