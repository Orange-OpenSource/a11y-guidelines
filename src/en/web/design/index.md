# WCAG based guidelines for design

This set of criteria intended for websites and web applications focuses on criteria to be taken in account during the design phase; it doesn’t tackle the code-related criteria. It is aimed at product owners, designers, project managers, etc.

Sites created for Orange must also be compliant with the [Orange Design Guidelines](https://design.orange.com/guidelines/) (“Web browsing”, “Digital Colour Palettes”, “Accessibility”) that detail the color usage, the type system…).

Two other versions are available:
- The development version tackles the code. It is aimed at developers, technical managers, etc.
- The test version presents the procedures and tools to check compliance with the criteria. Tests are organized by profile and tools. It is aimed at designers, developers, testers, accessibility experts, etc.
