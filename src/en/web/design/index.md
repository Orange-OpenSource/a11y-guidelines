# WCAG based guidelines for design

This set of criteria intended for websites and web applications focuses on criteria to be taken in account during the design phase; it doesn’t tackle the code-related criteria. It is aimed at product owners, designers, project managers, etc.

Sites created for Orange must also be compliant with the [Orange Design Guidelines](https://design.orange.com/) (“Web browsing”, “Digital Colour Palettes”, “Accessibility”) that detail the color usage, the type system, etc.

Two other versions are available:
- The **[development version](/en/web/develop/)** tackles the code. It is aimed at developers, technical managers, etc.
- The **[test version](/en/web/test/)** presents the procedures and tools to check compliance with the criteria. Tests are organized by profile and tool. It is aimed at designers, developers, testers, accessibility experts, etc.
