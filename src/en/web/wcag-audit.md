# Web - WCAG conformity audit

The purpose of the WCAG conformity audit is to calculate the compliance rates found in the accessibility statements which are available on Orange websites.

Orange has developed a grid of questions called the va11ydette. This grid consists of 74 questions, that between them cover the 56 criteria of the WCAG version 2.2 levels A and AA. Each question is used to validate or invalidate one or more criteria, and any given criterion can be addressed by one or more questions.

The grid calculates a compliance rate per page audited: this rate is equal to the sum of the criteria that are compliant, divided by the number of criteria that are applicable. It also calculates the average compliance rate, which corresponds to the average of the compliance rates of the pages tested.
