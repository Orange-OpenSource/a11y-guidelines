# WCAG conformity audit

The purpose of the WCAG conformity audit is to calculate the compliance rates found in the accessibility statements which are available on Orange websites. 

Orange has developed a grid of questions called the va11ydette. This grid consists of 64 questions, that between them cover the 50 criteria of the WCAG version 2.1 levels A and AA. Each question is used to validate or invalidate one or more criteria, and any given criterion can be addressed by one or more questions. 

The grid calculates a compliance rate per page audited: this rate is equal to the sum of the criteria that are compliant, divided by the number of criteria that are applicable. It also calculates the average compliance rate, which corresponds to the average of the compliance rates of the pages tested.

# Evaluation audit

The evaluation audit provides some tests and procedures to check compliance with the accessibility criteria recommended for the Orange projects.

This checklist is not limited to WCAG level A and AA, but also covers good practices and some AAA criteria.

This grid can be used at various projects steps : it may be used by different profiles (developer, qualifier, accessibility experts), whether for an initial audit, or for acceptance phases. It is also possible to filter criteria by tools or test methods (aXe,Colour Contrast Analyser,keyboard navigation,...).
