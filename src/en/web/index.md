***Accessibility, a benefit for all, a need for some!***

## Web accessibility definition
**An accessible web service can be used by anyone:**

- A valid person,
- elderly people,
- people with disabilities (temporary or permanent).

**and in all situations:**

- with any kind of material: web browser, PC, MAC, mobile phones, tablet;
- in an unfavourable environment: poor luminosity, touchpad while moving, etc.;
- with specific software that compensates a disability.
