# Measure the color contrast level

The contrast level can be measured simply by using the [Colour Contrast Analyser tool](http://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/).

This tool is available for Mac and Windows. It measures the contrast between two colours (text colour and background colour). You can select them using an eyedropper directly into a web page, image or application.
