# WCAG based guidelines for testing

This set of criteria intended for websites and web applications presents the procedures and tools to check compliance with the criteria. Tests are organized by profile and tool. It is aimed at designers, developers, testers, accessibility experts, etc..

Sites created for Orange must also be compliant with the [Orange Design guidelines](https://design.orange.com/guidelines/) (“Web browsing”, “Digital Colour Palettes”, “Accessibility”) that detail the color usage, the type system,etc.

Two other versions are available:
- The **[design version](/en/web/design/)** focuses on design-related criteria. It is aimed at product owners, designers, project managers, etc.
- The **[development version](/en/web/develop/)** tackles the code. It is aimed at developers, technical managers, etc.
