## WCAG

For Orange internal accessibility requirements, we have chosen to rely on the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines v2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/) (<abbr>WCAG</abbr> 2.1). Those guidelines are international guidelines published by the World Wide Web Consortium (<abbr>W3C</abbr>) Web Accessibility Initiative (<abbr>WAI</abbr>) task force, which comply with the <abbr>ISO</abbr> standard 40500:2012.

All <abbr>HTML</abbr> pages made by the Orange group must **comply with the AA level criteria of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (<abbr>WCAG</abbr>) 2.1, without blocking point** for the user after testing the main features of the site or application.

For technical solutions, you should consult [WCAG criteria by project phase](../test/) and [examples](../components-examples/) sections. You can also refer to an external resource available at [Accede-Web references](http://wiki.accede-web.com/en/home).

## <abbr>RGAA</abbr>

The <abbr>RGAA</abbr> is the French governmentâ€™s [General Accessibility Reference for improving accessibility (in French)](https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/publications/rgaa-accessibilite/). It is meant to provide a way to check compliance against <abbr>WCAG</abbr> 2.1.
If your are familiar with this reference, you can use it to test your site.
