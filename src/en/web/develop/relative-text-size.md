# Use relative size to allow changing text size and responsive design

**Target: **everyone and especially people with visual impairments, using a device outdoors and elderly people.  
**When: **during development.

**Description: **

Use relative length units for font size (`em`, `rem`, `%`) and for containers handling text size enlargement up to 200% and design your pages to be responsive.

**Checklist: **

- Do not use pixel (`px`) for size that must adapt if we increase the text size (impossible with Internet Explorer).
- Form fields must also have relative sizes to enlarge properly.
- Try to make the container adaptive so they can increase in size when the text is zoomed in.
- In Firefox, go to View>Zoom and activate Zoom text only, set the zoom to 200%. Verify that there is no loss of information (disappearance or overlapping text).
- Content must respond to screen size changes, adjusting its contents without horizontal scroll even when screen width is reduced to 320 CSS pixels, unless special needs (map, table, diagram... ).

**Users’ goal: **

Allow users (visually impaired, using a device outdoors, elderly people…) to increase the font size and enlargement of the page so they can access easily the information.

**Example:** 
See the example [handling zoom, increasing the text size](./exemples/zoom/index.html) for more details.
