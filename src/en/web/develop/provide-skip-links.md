# Provide skip links

**Target: **useful for mobile and tablet users, people with visual impairments, motor disabilities or using a device outdoors.  
**When: **as of design and during development.

**Description: **

Provide skip links allowing to access directly the main page areas (navigation, content, bottom of the page, search…) with internal links pointing to anchors. (`<a>` tags or any <abbr>HTML</abbr> element with an `id` attribute). In **very specific** cases, the links can be hidden on the screen and appear only when keyboard navigation is detected.

**Checklist: **
When a skip link is activated, make sure the focus is correctly set (not only scrolled to the right position).

**Users’ goal: **

Facilitate the navigation for users using a keyboard, visually impaired, users of magnifying glass software or mobile phone.
     
**Example: ** 
Skip links (“Skip to navigation”, “Skip to content”) are available on this site.
To make them appear, move the focus on the top of the page by clicking on your browser’s address bar, for example, then repeatedly press the <kbd>TAB</kbd> key.
