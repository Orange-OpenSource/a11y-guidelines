# Allowing animations control

**Target: **people with visual impairments, reading, attention or understanding difficulties, people with seizure disorders.  
**When: **when designing the service and graphic design.

**Description:**  
All moving, refreshed, flashing or scrolling content (eg a carousel) must be able to be stopped, hidden or paused by the user if this animation lasts more than 5 seconds.

Also, avoid as much as possible flashing content and sudden brightness changes (see [The logo of the Olympics causes seizures](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/london/6724245.stm)).

Therefore, it is necessary to pause the animation when loading the page or to give a way to stop or pause the animation, the update or the flashing via a button for example.

**Example: **

A carousel that automatically scrolls must be paused when the mouse is over it or when it receives the focus.  
It is also possible to add a “pause” button directly in the interface.
