# WCAG based guidelines for web development
This set of criteria intended for websites and web applications describes code-related accessibility criteria. It is aimed at developers, technical managers, etc.

Sites created for Orange must also be compliant with the [Orange Design guidelines](https://design.orange.com/guidelines/) (“Web browsing”, “Digital Colour Palettes”, “Accessibility”) that detail the color usage, the type system, etc.

Two other versions are available:
- The **[design version](/en/web/design/)** focuses on design-related criteria. It is aimed at product owners, designers, project managers, etc.
- The **[test version](/en/web/test/)** presents the procedures and tools to check compliance with the criteria. Tests are organized by profile and tool. It is aimed at designers, developers, testers, accessibility experts, etc.
