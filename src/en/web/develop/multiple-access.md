# Provide multiple access and location

**Target:** Everyone, especially people who are visually or cognitively impaired.

**Description: **  
Give the user several ways to locate and access specific content, locate the web page being viewed in a set of pages. When the page is a step in a process where the pages follow one after the other, providing a way to locate can be ignored.

**Checklist: **  
Make sure that several systems allow you to locate and access a page or content in the site & nbsp ;: a search tool on the entire site, a site map, a global navigation menu, a breadcrumb trail...

**User Objective: **  
Allow all users to find their way in order to access more easily all the content of the site.

**Do: **  
The site offers, at the same time, a complete and precise main navigation and a breadcrumb trail.

**Don't: **  
An application provides a parcel navigation menu and no other way for the user to navigate the pages or locate where the current page is in the tree.
