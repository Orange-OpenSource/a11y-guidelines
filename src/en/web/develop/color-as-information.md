# Do not use colour or sensory characteristics as the unique source of information

**Target:** everyone, especially the colour-blind and more generally people with visual impairments, cognitive limitations, hearing impairments and elderly people.  
**When:** as of design and during development.

**Description:** 
Do not use colour or sensory characteristics (shape, size, sound, direction, visual localization …) as the only way of conveying information, indicating an action, requesting a response or distinguishing an element. The information provided by a colour change or a sensory characteristic must be completed with textual information (alternative) or / and semantic structuring.

**Checklist:**
- Take a screenshot and convert it in black and white. The loss of colour should not cause difficulty while navigating, nor cause loss of information.
- Turn off the speakers, the level of information should remain the same.
- Be sure that links are not only identified by a different colour, usually underline them. If the are not underlined, on focus and on hover, provide an another way than color to distinguish them.

**Example:**  
For a pie chart, where each part is coloured differently, you could add different pattern fills to identify them without colour.
 
**Do:**

**Don’t:**

This example is not valid because the information is conveyed only by colour.


**Users’ goal:**

Allow users not distinguishing colours or sensory information (colour blind, visually impaired, hearing impaired, mobile users in bright environment or in noisy environments …) to access the same information by other means.
