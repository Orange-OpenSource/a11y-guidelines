# Offer an alternative to complex gestures

**Target: **Everyone, especially people with motor or visual disabilities and mobility.  
**When: **during design and development.

**Description: **  
- For each complex gesture interaction or path-based interaction (<span lang = "en"> swipe, drag, pinch </ span> ...), an alternative must be available (for example a non-gestural or simplified alternative) unless this gesture or this trajectory is essential (eg signature).
- In the same way, for the interactions requiring a change of orientation of the apparatus or a movement of the user (tilting, rotation, shaking ...), this functionality can be deactivated and must have an alternative in the interface.

**Complex gesture:** any multi-pointer gesture (requiring several fingers), and / or path-bases gesture.  
**Simplified gesture:** an alternative requiring a single pointer (one finger) without path-based gesture.
