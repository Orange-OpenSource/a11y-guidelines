# List of Essential Accessibility Criteria

This set of criteria, designed for web sites and applications, helps to avoid the main accessibility errors.
Its implementation does not guarantee an accessible site, but lays the foundations for a progressive approach to accessibility.

Compliance with the Orange graphic charter called [Design System Orange](https://design.orange.com/) is a prerequisite for using this base.
Certain points already present in the Orange charter (use of colors, text alignment, etc.) have not been included in this list of criteria.

This guided test grid is intended for designers, developers, qualifiers, product owners, etc. It should be used with the recommended tools to ensure reliable results.
