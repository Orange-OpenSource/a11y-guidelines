# WCAG criteria by project phase

This base criteria for the Orange websites and applications avoids the major accessibility errors.
Its implementation does not give you the guarantee to be 100% accessible, but is a clean bedrock so you can engage in a progressive accessibility implementation process.

Following the Orange guidelines (<cite>Design for digital platforms Guidelines</cite>), available on the [Orange brand site](http://design.orange.com/) is a prerequisite to the use of this base criteria. 
Some elements already present in the Orange Brand (such as the use of colours, text alignment...) have not been included in this list of criteria.

Three versions are available:
- **The design version** does not mention the code, it is aimed at product designers, designers, project managers, etc.
- **The development version** mentions the code and is aimed at developers, technical managers, validation teams, testers, etc.
- **The test version** presents the procedures to follow in order to validate the compliance of each recommendation. It is intended for designers, developers, qualifiers, etc.
