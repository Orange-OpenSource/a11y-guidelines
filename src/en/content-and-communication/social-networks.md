# Accessible communication on social networks

This part indicates how to make your content on social networks as accessible as possible.

## General guidelines

### Post writing
- [Keep the accentuation on the capital letters](/fr/contenu-et-communication/#comment-mettre-des-accents-aux-majuscules) (example: É or Ç).
On a mobile phone, simply hold your finger on the letter to be accentuated.
- If the post is written on an image or a background color, [maintain sufficient contrast with the text](/en/web/develop/colors-and-contrasts/#provide-enough-contrast-between-front-and-background-colors).
Use a [tool to check the contrast](/en/web/toolbox/methods-and-test-tools/color-contrast-level/).

### Links
- Name the links in a way that makes it easy to understand the action or destination of the link. Example: Avoid "Clic here", prefer "The package in detail…".
- Clarify the link destination for a photo, video or audio ; specify it by adding [IMAGE], [VIDEO] or [AUDIO] at the beginning of the title. Example: "[VIDEO] Our brand's latest campaign.".

### Hashtags
- Put a capital letter at the beginning of each word (write in CamelCase) 
This makes reading easier by helping to distinguish the different words and it allows the screen reader to differentiate the number of words.
For example #AllUnited is more readable than #ALLUNITED.
- Place hashtags at the end of posts/tweets.

### Emojis
Each emoji has a unique description that is transcribed vocally by a screen reader
- Use emojis sparingly.
- Ensure the exact meaning of the emojis used to avoid misunderstandings or misinterpretations: check what will be read using [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/).
- Do not put several identical emojis in a row.
- Use them at the end of posts.

### Images
The images must be completed with a replacement text (see below for the instructions according to the social network)
- Add a replacement text (an alternative description) to the images
  - If text is present in the image, include the text in the description
  - Do not start the description with "image of" because the image is detected as such by the technical aids 
  - If an image description and a caption are filled in, be careful not to put redundant information as much as possible
- Check the image contrast
  - For any image containing text, [check that the contrast is sufficient (/en/web/develop/colors-and-contrasts/#provide-enough-contrast-between-front-and-background-colors).
Use a [tool to check the contrast](/en/web/test/#test-colors-and-contrasts).

### Videos
All videos should have subtitles and if possible a transcript.
- YouTube allows you to automatically generate subtitles. You can download the .SRT from YouTube.
- For social networks that do not generate automatic subtitles, there are tools like [MixCaptions (AppStore)](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mixcaptions-video-captions/id952426779) or [AutoCap (GooglePlay)](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.laika.kinetictypovid&hl=en_US&gl=US).
- Note: Although there are tools that can automatically generate subtitles, it is often necessary to verify them.

## Twitter

### Images
By default Twitter fills in the alternative of an image with the text "image".
To add custom descriptions to images:
- Add an image to the tweet.
- Edit / add a description to the image.
- Fill in the description of the image.
- Publish the tweet.

### Videos
If the video does not already have subtitles, the Media Studio tool allows you to add them.

[How to use videos on Twitter](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/media-studio).

If you do not have access to Media Studio, [use another tool](#videos).

### Voice messages
Twitter allows to tweet audio messages. This feature is still in beta and only available on IOS. To improve accessibility, Twitter has also added automatically generated transcripts.

It is not recommended to use them, the feature is not yet optimized for accessibility.

### Stories

Instagram stories are not yet very accessible.
To communicate important information, it is necessary to put it on the personal wall. 


## TikTok

Tiktok provides users with videos of diverse and varied content.

It is essentially based on viewing videos and may therefore be inaccessible to as deaf or a blind person.

### Text-to-speech

Text-to-speech converts typed text into a voiceover as it appears in the video. This feature is particularly helpful for visually impaired or blind users.

In order to make a video accessible, vocal synthesis can be added while editing the video by taping on the text then selecting “Text-to-speech". A synthetic voice will read the text clearly during the video.

### Auto caption

Auto captions transcribe a video’s spoken audio into text. This feature helps viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing enjoy content without missing context.

Users can add captions during video editing after they’ve uploaded or recorded a video. The text is automatically transcribed and can be edited before it’s displayed on your video.

However, this option in currently only available in English or Japanese. (05/22)
