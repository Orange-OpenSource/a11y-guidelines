# Momindum Maker recommandations 

The best practices detailed in this article apply to the *Momindum Maker* tool, allowing you to create video presentations from a *Powerpoint* document.
It is therefore imperative as a prerequisite to apply <a href="/en/content-and-communication/powerpoint/"> the Powerpoint recommendations </a> on the document serving as the basis for the presentation.

## Project properties
Provide at least the title and the language.

- *Project title*
The title of the project is included in the *page title* and in the *main title*.
These are 2 very important things for screen reader users.

- *Language*
The choice of language defines the translation of the navigation elements (eg: play / pause, navigation menu, etc.).

## Offer alternatives to audio and video tracks
- *Closed captions*
	- *Offer subtitles* as an alternative to the audio track (automatic transcription is adapted, or .SRT subtitles)
	- *Do not offer embedded subtitles* in the video

- *Transcription*
	- Provide a full transcription of the video as a text file (txt, word, html)
	- Make sure to fill in an understandable title for the document

## Define a plan
- *The plan system generated by Momindum is accessible.*
It can in particular be used from a keyboard navigation or a screen reader, and prove to be very useful for navigation within the presentation.

- It is imperative that the wording is relevant.

## Quizz
Momindum quizzes can be used (see however the remarks in the paragraph <a href="/en/content-and-communication/e-learning/momindum/#accessibility-defects"> accessibility defects </a>.

- However, propose *the result in the form of text*, because the information (good / bad answer) is given only by color (it will not be perceived by blind or visually impaired users).

## Accessibility defects

While good practices can make a Momindum Maker presentation usable, there are still some drawbacks that impact end users:

- *Autoplay:*
Play / pause actions are not possible from keyboard navigation.
It is therefore necessary to offer automatic reading, contrary to the usual recommendations, in order not to block keyboard users.

- *Quizz :*
It is possible to take the quizz from technical help, however:

	- Perception of responses should be improved.
	Screen reader users may not perceive them depending on their browsing mode.
	- Answers are selected systematically in the form of a checkbox.
	However, when only one answer is possible, the radio button format is more suitable.
	Screen reader users could be misled.
