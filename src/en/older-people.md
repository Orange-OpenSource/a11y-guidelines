<h2 class="page-title">Older people</h2>

### Summary

An older person (“senior”) belongs to a category of people whose definition varies according to context: work, health, etc. Regarding health, the World Health Organisation defines an older person as being over 60 years old. They estimate that between 2000 and 2050 this population will double on a world level, going from 11% to 22%. According to INSERM, French National Institute of Health and Medical Research, the decline in cognitive abilities begins at 45.

Age-related disabilities impact our use of digital technologies.

### Obstacles found

Obstacles found by people suffering from age-related disabilities can be numerous:

- Lower **vision**: lower sensitivity to contrast, colour blindness, lower capacity to concentrate on close objects, make it difficult to read a digital resource.
- Lower **motor** capabilities: lower dexterity, fine motor control, make it difficult to handle a mouse and to click on smaller elements.
- Lower **hearing**: lower ability to perceive high-pitched sounds, to separate sounds, make it difficult to listen to audio documents (especially in a noisy environment).
- Lower **cognitive** capabilities: lower short-term memory, concentration, make it difficult to browse and achieve tasks.
