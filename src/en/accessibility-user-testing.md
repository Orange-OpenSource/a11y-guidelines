# Orange digital accessibility guidelines

## Accessibility user testing

In order to evaluate the accessibility of a site, application, or product, accessibility experts conduct audits with the objective to check their compliance against standard or best practices rules (<abbr>WCAG</abbr> 2.1 Level AA for web).

Once the application is compliant or mostly compliant with guidelines, experts can complete their audit with tests performed by users with disabilities. 

In ergonomics: «User testing is the main method for evaluating the user experience in an iterative process. The evaluation relies on the observation of users performing a set of tasks while interacting with a system. Data collected regarding their behavior, reactions and performances provide information about strengths and weaknesses of the evaluated system, as well as about the experience of users.» (translated from <a href="http://tecfaetu.unige.ch/etu-maltt/xerneas/jaquiet7/tests_utilisateurs_(Lallemand2016).pdf" title="Méthodes de design UX (french PDF file)" aria-label="Méthodes de design UX (french PDF file)">Méthodes de design UX</a>. Carine Lallemand & Guillaume Gronier. Eyrolles, 2016).
The goal of the accessibility expert is not so sharp. User tests will mainly allow to: 
 - Ensure people with disabilities can use the application (absence of blocking points) 
 - (If difficulties) List new anomalies identified thanks to the user test in progress
 - Confirm and illustrate the remaining anomalies detected during previous audit 
 - Have concrete elements to prioritize corrections

To enable non-ergonomic accessibility experts to realise relevant user tests, we have defined a detailed protocol that is reproducible whatever the application. The protocol consists of 5 parts; only the third stage (application interaction) depends on the application being tested. 

1.	Reception of the participant (context, objective, instructions) 
2.	Information regarding the participant profile
    - His/her characteristics (age, digital experience…), equipment of his computer station and job
    - His/her experience with using the application
3.	Testing: users interacts with the application following scenarios of use
    - 2 to 5 scenarios are defined based on the main tasks of the application
4.	User feedback 
    - The feeling after interaction (appreciations, difficulties, suggestions) 
    - The ergonomic qualities of the application
5.	Conclusion 
    - Opinion on the test and information on the continuation of the study

Users are volunteers, ideally 4 or 5 users with different impairments using different assistive technologies (or not using assistive technologies). Tests are performed with the user's own equipment, face-to-face (in person or remotely) or over the phone. Each test lasts no more than 1:30 hours. Sessions are not recorded and the anonymity of the participant is preserved.
