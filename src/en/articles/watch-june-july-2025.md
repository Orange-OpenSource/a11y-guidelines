# Digital accessibility watch June - July 2025

Part of the Orange Accessibility Competence Center team was at A11Y Paris at the end of June. Many people and an always interesting program, another great opportunity for peer-to-peer exchanges with newcomers on a growing topic...
I wasn't aware of all these public sector A11Y grants. Here's a good summary from Access42 (fr): https://access42.net/aides-financement-accessibilite-numerique-secteur-public/.
We're celebrating the implementation of the EAA (European Accessibility Act) on June 28, 2025. Here's a great summary of this European act: https://digitalaccessibilitycentre.org/blogs/NewEAA-20241217.html#common-requirements-for-all-products-and-services.
Still lots to read during these holidays!
