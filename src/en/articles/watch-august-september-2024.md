# Digital accessibility watch August-September 2024

Little watch, back from vacation!
Sometimes, people are tired of fighting against windmills: https://robertkingett.com/posts/6617/ but, as I often say, favor continuous improvement rather than screwing perfection: https://accessibilityfirstsolutions.com/transform-accessibility/.
And another opinion on WCAG and their form, sometimes not very adapted and understandable: https://yatil.net/blog/my-grief-with-in-brief.
Happy reading...
