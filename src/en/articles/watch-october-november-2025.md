# Digital accessibility watch October-November 2025

To start, here are two great tech and a11y advent calendars (fr): https://www.24joursdeweb.fr/ and https://www.htmhell.dev/adventcalendar/.

And then there's progress (it's becoming clearer...) regarding the complaints filed by ApiDV (Accompanying, Promoting, Integrating Visually Impaired People) against major retailers for non-compliance with the EAA (Accessibility Advisory Agreement), and finally, its transposition into French law (fr):

- https://www.interetaagir.org/assignation-en-refere-des-entreprises-auchan-carrefour-e-leclerc-et-picard-surgeles/.

That's all, happy holidays everyone!
