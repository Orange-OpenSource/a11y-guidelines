In Europe, starting June 28th 2025, all the products and services that Orange releases must be accessible.

This standard specifies the accessibility requirements for information and communications technology such as devices, websites, mobile apps or digital documents. EN 301 549 is the standard on which the European Accessibility Act is based, its final version will be released in February 2026.
