# Digital accessibility watch February-Maarch 2022
Some information that seemed important to me!
The accessibility of French public sites has been an obligation in law since 2012, another fight that has not progressed for far too long, still the rights of people with disabilities flouted by the administration. However, the gov has communicated a lot about the figure of 40% of accessible virtual procedures, the reality is very far from that (fr): https://cncph.fr/chiffres-web-public/.
Another example of non-respect of the fundamental rights of people with disabilities, the presidential campaign, where the sites and the campaign of the candidates are far from being accessible (fr):
