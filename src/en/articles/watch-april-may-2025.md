# Digital accessibility watch April - May 2025

Good news: the European Commission clearly states that overlays do not make web sites accessible, and we're making progress (fr): https://design.numerique.gouv.fr/articles/2025-04-03-les-surcouches-ne-rendent-ni-accessible-ni-conforme/. 

The CNCPH, the National Consultative Council for People with Disabilities, is more pessimistic about the progress of accessibility in France (fr): https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oP88duDOzIxFjqg3MhbomEOFqA0gPuue/view .

And finally, WebAim's annual study of 1 million websites still doesn't produce amazing results; it's progressing, but very, very slowly: https://webaim.org/projects/million/.
