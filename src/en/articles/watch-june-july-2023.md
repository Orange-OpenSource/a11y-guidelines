# Digital accessibility watch June-July 2023

Two rich months in terms of recommendations. First an update of the WCAG 3.0 working draft, https://www.w3.org/TR/wcag-3.0/ and some clarifications, https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/wcag3-intro/. Then, the passage in candidate recommendation of WCAG 2.2, <https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/> and some explanations of the novelties of this version (final?), https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/new-in-22/. And finally, the official release of the ARIA 1.2 recommendation, https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-wai-announce/2023AprJun/0005.html.
The Association Aveugles de France has launched an a11y observatory, more than 2,000 sites organized into several themes. Finally, in summary it's not brilliant but to follow, (fr) https://observatoire-access-num.interieursdefrance.org/!
Another initiative, a commitment charter for RGAA compliance audits set up and supported by the CNCPH (National Advisory Council for People with Disabilities), (fr) https://cncph.fr/charte-rgaa/.
