# Digital accessibility monitoring June-July 2022
We're talking about Domino again (the pizzas not the game!), spoiler alert: they lost and bingo, headshot: https://www.adatitleiii.com/2022/06/robles-v-dominos-settles-after-six-years-of-litigation/.
As I always say (warning: assertion by old a11y expert), the problem in accessibility is that we're doing our best, we spare the goat and the cabbage, another very good example https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2022/06/voice-control-usability-considerations-partially-visually-hidden-link-names/
Well, again and again, we talk about overlays, a point of view that has consensus in the a11y community: https://karlgroves.com/overlays-are-here-to-stay-so-are-male-enhancement-pills/ to go further, a list of best practices: https://convergeaccessibility.com/2022/06/20/best-practices-for-overlays-part-2/
Great news, official release of the translation of WCAG 2.1 in French (fr): https://www.w3.org/Translations/WCAG21-fr/) including yours truly and member of the translation committee.
And finally, my quick editorial, latest WCAG 2.2 news (publication still scheduled for September, we're getting ready) and 3: https://whollyaccessible.org/2022/06/02/wcag-2-2-and-wcag-3-status-updates/.
