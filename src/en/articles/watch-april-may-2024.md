# Digital accessibility watch April - May 2024

First of all, I encourage you to contact ARCOM if you find inaccessible sites that do not comply with the law (fr): https://www.temesis.com/blog/saisir-larcom-concernant-laccessibilite-dun-site-est-ce-efficace/, because the more there are of us, the more weight it will have!
Then, the release of a draft of WCaG 3.0 is still awaited and scrutinized: https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/wcag3-intro/
Here are some reactions:
- https://www.deque.com/blog/w3c-unveils-174-new-outcomes-for-wcag-3-0/
- https://cerovac.com/a11y/2024/05/perfect-timing-for-new-wcag-3-guideline-considerations/
- https://www.w3.org/blog/2024/the-wcag-3-working-draft-update-is-ready-for-your-review/

Let's not forget that May 16 was GAAD (Global Accessibility Awareness Day), everything is here: https://accessibility.day/
But, even after 25 years of the release of WCAG 1.0, well https://cerovac.com/a11y/2024/05/wcag-after-quarter-of-a-century-we-still-need-more-awareness/
good reading!
