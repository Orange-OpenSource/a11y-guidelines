# Digital accessibility watch October-November 2021

A little late this time but, hey, the holidays and all that...

On these times, the famous 24 days of web, the web advent calendar (fr): https://www.24joursdeweb.fr.

We continue with a rant over the French stagnation at the A11y, https://www.yanous.com/pratique/informatique/pointsdevue211001.html, basically without sanctions nothing will advance!

To follow up on the lawsuits brought by Facil'iti, Koena files its conclusions for the trial https://koena.net/proces-faciliti-conclusions-koena-12-novembre-2021/.

And on the same topic, another site on accessibility overlays: https://overlayfalseclaims.com.

Happy Holidays !
