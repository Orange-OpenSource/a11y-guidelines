## Introduction
You may have noticed that we now offer 3 new **must-haves criteria** checklists to help you start your journey towards accessible production.

This idea emerged when we realized that, far too often, we detected many non-conformities during the final audit period or accessibility declaration, even though these issues could have been avoided earlier without the need for experts on the subject.

To assist projects in improving their products from the design phase, during development, and without waiting for an expert's verdict, we started creating a testing grid that anyone could execute without expertise and with very few tools.

These checklists are aimed at various contributor profiles on a project during the design, build, or run phases.

Without further ado, here are our checklists:

- <a href="https://a11y-guidelines.orange.com/en/web/must-haves-checklist/">Must-haves for Web</a>
- <a href="https://a11y-guidelines.orange.com/en/mobile/android/checklist/">Must-haves for Android</a>
- <a href="https://a11y-guidelines.orange.com/en/mobile/ios/">Must-haves for iOS</a>


## Why These Criteria?
We have defined 11 criteria, categorized by themes for your convenience. Why 11? To remind you of the _11_ in the numeral **a11y**, of course!

Some WCAG criteria are not always easy to understand or test, so to avoid frustration, we ensured that each criterion is easy to test.

Note that these criteria will not fully make your product accessible, but no doubt that they are essential to achieve that goal.

### Common Criteria for Web and Mobile
- Provide titles for each screen
- Text alternatives for images
- Sufficient text contrast
- Color must not be the only source of information
- Keyboard navigation
- Form field names
- Relevant error messages

### Specific Web Criteria
- Provide headings for sections
- Indicate the primary language
- Control of animations
- Responsive display

### Specific Mobile Criteria
- Text increase
- Touch target size
- Portrait and landscape orientation
- Screen reader output


## How to Use the Checklists?
We present each criterion in 3 parts:

- Procedure: what you need to do with the code inspector or the proposed tool
- Check: what you need to verify
- Results: what you need to observe


## Expert tip
Some criteria are easily implementable and testable in web and mobile page templates or mockups.

For example:
- Document language
- Page title
- Colors and contrasts
- Keyboard navigation and focus visibility


## Conclusion
We rely on you to use these checklists at the start of each project and regularly throughout the project to ensure no regression.
