# Digital accessibility watch October-November 2024

To start an interview with a comrade, Olivier Nourry, a long-standing fighter in accessibility (fr): https://access42.net/interview-olivier-nourry-expert-accessibility-numerique/.
And then, because it is the season, the famous Advent calendar 24 days of web with lots of a11y in it (fr): https://www.24joursdeweb.fr/2024.
Last advice, the replays of ParisWeb 2024, the conference, the only one to see if you are in digital accessibility, web quality and eco-design with lots of love in it. I chose two conferences that I liked but there are many others (fr):
