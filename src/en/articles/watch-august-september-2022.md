# Digital accessibility watch August-October 2022
Well, big delay for this new watch, but here it is finally!
A draft of an unofficial specification on AOM (Accessibility Object Model), important for assistive technologies https://wicg.github.io/aom/spec/.
Soon WCAG 2.2, two thoughts on this candidate recommendation: https://www.deque.com/blog/wcag-2-2-is-at-the-candidate-recommendation-stage/ https://intopia.digital/articles/wcag-2-2-hits-candidate-recommendation-but-what-does-it-mean/ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eDCd-isluUY.
