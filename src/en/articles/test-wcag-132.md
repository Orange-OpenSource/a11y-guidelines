## General explanation

The purpose of [WCAG 1.3.2 criterion](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/meaningful-sequence) is to ensure that if the order of content is important, it should be preserved regardless of how it is presented to the user, for example if CSS is disabled or if a screen reader is used.

The order of content is <strong>important</strong> if the order of the content cannot be changed without affecting its meaning.
For example, for an ordered list or a table, the order of the content is important, but for an unordered list, the reading order can be changed without affecting the user's understanding.

In a WEB page, the position of a navigation section and the main section of the page, generally, does not affect the understanding of the content of the page, whether the navigation is, first or second, it does not there is therefore no specific reading order for understanding these two parts of the page.
There can therefore exist several reading orders on a WEB page to satisfy the success criterion.

## What you should not do

### Use white space to format plain text

When presenting content, it is important not to use blank character, such as spaces, tabs, line feeds or carriage returns.
In some cases, these characters are used to format tables, or columns of data in textual content. This method is prohibited because assistive technologies will not be presented with the information in a logical reading order, and the information returned by this technology will be incomprehensible.


Below are two examples that are not valid for screen readers.

#### Example of a blank character to format a tables

<pre class="border border-light">

            Monday               Tuesday           Wednesday     

 Morning    9.30 a.m.            9.30 a.m.         8.00 a.m.
            to 1 p.m.            to 1 p.m.         to twelve oâ€™clock     
            B201                 B201              A001

Afternoon   2 p.m                2 p.m             Break
            to 5 p.m.            to 5 p.m.
            A103                 B201

</pre>

We note that the presentation above is very visual, but the text is not suitable, because it is impossible to represent the tabular relations.
Which changes the meaning of readings for assistive technologies. A table should be used or the information should be presented in a linear fashion.

#### Example of a blank character to separate content into two columns

<p class="border border-light">
Digital accessibility aims to make possible &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; it is not a question of multiplying <br/>
access to digital information whatever &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;media, but from<br/>
the nature of the person's disability and the way &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; respect functional rules, graphics, <br/>
whose information everyone consults. It concerns &emsp;&emsp;&emsp; technical and editorial that will allow everyone <br/>
different technologies such as the Web, videos &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; to access information regardless of their <br/>
and Word and PDF documents, but also the &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp; consulting tools. <br/>
digital television or mobile phones. &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
</p>

The paragraph above is not compliant, blank characters are used to separate the text into two columns, but assistive technologies will read the text line by line thus affecting the reading order.

### Use a layout table

Although WCAG does not prohibit the use of layout tables, it is recommended to use layout in CSS in order to maintain the semantic reading of the content. If a layout table is used, it is important that the content is meaningful when linearized.

Tables present content horizontally and vertically, however an assistive technology reads this content in a linear fashion, the table is read from top to bottom reading the entire row before moving on to the next.

This is why you have to be careful when using a layout table, you have to check that the content is understandable with a screen reader.

#### Example of an invalid table

<table role="presentation" class="m-2 border border-light">
  <tr>
    <td><a href="#">Home <span class="visually-hidden">(exemple)</span></a></td>
    <td rowspan="4"><img src="/assets/images/orange-logo.svg" alt="example logo" width="100" height="100
    "></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="#">Team<span class="visually-hidden">(exemple)</span></a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="#">News <span class="visually-hidden">(exemple)</span></a></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><a href="#">Contact <span class="visually-hidden">(exemple)</span></a></td>
  </tr>
</table>

The table above displays a menu, with the logo on the side.

The problem is that to the screen reader the reading order is changed, because instead of stating all the menu links, the image will be vocalized in the middle of them.

### Use CSS to position information

To position content, it is recommended to use structural markup, in order to put it in the correct reading order, rather than the positioning properties of CSS. This can lead to errors because the content may be displayed in a different order than it is in the source code.

Care must be taken with the use of CSS Flexbox, grid and position

<ul>
   <li>With CSS flexbox, avoid using the <code>order</code> or <code>flex-direction:reverse property ;</code></li>
   <li>With CSS grid, be careful about manually placing elements on the grid</li>
   <li>With positioning properties, avoid detaching the visual order of elements from the order in which they appear in the DOM</li>
</ul>

If a user disables CSS, or uses a screen reader, the rendering of information will no longer be in the correct order.

#### Example of a position menu in CSS

The layout below was created with CSS, if you disable the CSS, you will notice that the reading direction will be different than the one displayed.

<div class="border border-light position-relative mb-3" style="width: 320px;height:180px">      
     <span class="position-absolute top-0 start-0"><strong>Sports</strong></span>       
     <span class="position-absolute top-0 end-0"><strong>Products</strong></span>       
     <span class="position-absolute top-50 start-0">Football</span>       
     <span class="position-absolute start-0" style="top:75%!important">Tennis</span>       
     <span class="position-absolute start-0" style="top:90%!important">Rugby</span>       
     <span class="position-absolute top-50 end-0">Clothes</span>       
     <span class="position-absolute end-0" style="top:75%!important">Accessories</span>
</div>

#### Example of a tab where the content is positioned before

In the example below, tabs will be displayed with content that will be positioned with flexboxes.

<div class="d-flex flex-column mb-3">
  <div class="tab-content order-2" id="myTabContent">
    <div class="tab-pane fade show active" id="home" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="home-tab">You are now on the Home tab. </div>
    <div class="tab-pane fade" id="profile" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="profile-tab">You are now on the Profile tab.</div>
  </div>
  <ul class="nav nav-tabs order-1" id="myTab" role="tablist">
    <li class="nav-item" role="presentation">
      <button class="nav-link active" id="home-tab" data-bs-toggle="tab" data-bs-target="#home" type="button" role="tab" aria-controls="home" aria-selected="true">Home</button>
    </li>
    <li class="nav-item" role="presentation">
      <button class="nav-link" id="profile-tab" data-bs-toggle="tab" data-bs-target="#profile" type="button" role="tab" aria-controls="profile" aria-selected="false">Profile</button>
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

Elements are placed with the <code>order</code> attribute, which is not the same display order in the dom.
By disabling the CSS or the screen reader, we see that the meaning of the tabs is no longer the same.
