# Digital accessibility watch February - March 2023
In this month of March, the French report on the European directive on web a11y is here, but what a disappointment: (fr) https://koena.net/rapport-de-la-france-a-la-commission-europeenne-sur-la-directive-accessibilite-web-regles-du-jeu-modifiees/. In parallel, the transposition of the European act on the accessibility of products and services has also been released ((fr) https://access42.net/transposition-directive-europeenne-ue-2019-882-accessibilite-produits-services). A huge hope to see things improve for people with disabilities, but, well, we have to see what will come out of it ((fr) https://access42.net/impact-directive-europeenne-ue-2019-882-accessibilite-numerique, https://www.yanous.com/news/editorial/edito230303.html and 
https://acteurspublics.fr/articles/christian-volle-les-manquements-aux-obligations-daccessibilite-numerique-doivent-enfin-etre-sanctionnes)

Funny: the EN 301549 standard (the European standard from WCAG 2.2) used in Australia (https://www.accessibility.org.au/policy/australian-policy/)!

Happy spring reading!
