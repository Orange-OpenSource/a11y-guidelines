# Element magnification

## Enlarge texts without loss of information

**Target&nbsp;:** everyone and in particular the visually impaired.  
**When&nbsp;:** during design and development.

**Description&nbsp;:** 

The text size must be able to be multiplied by 2 (zoom the text to 200% from the phone's accessibility settings). At this zoom level, the presentation can be altered, but the information must remain legible (no truncated or overlapped text).

From the design phase, it must be ensured that the content is adaptive and that the text containers adjust to the text zoom. 

Furthermore, design choices may facilitate the implementation during development, so it is important to think about it from the start.

**To be verified&nbsp;:**

- The application reacts correctly to the text magnification option

**Tool&nbsp;:**
The text size magnification accessibility option, present in the phone settings.


**Valid example&nbsp;:**
