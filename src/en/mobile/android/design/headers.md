# Headers

## Have a relevant and unique screen title

**Target&nbsp;:** everyone
**When&nbsp;:** during design

**Description&nbsp;:** 

The page title is the first element that is vocalized or seen on a mobile screen. It makes navigation easier for everyone: at any time, you know where you are in the application.  
A common mistake is to put a unique title for all the pages of an application (or even no title at all).

**To be verified&nbsp;:** 

- Each screen has a title, which is specific and relevant

**Invalid example&nbsp;:**

<img src="../../../images/header.png" alt="example of irrelevant title (no title)" width="300" height="530">
