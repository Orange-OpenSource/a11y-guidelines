# Mobile criteria

This base criteria for the Android and iOS Orange mobile applications avoids major accessibility errors.
Its implementation does not give you the guarantee to be 100% accessible, but it is a clean bedrock so you can engage in a progressive accessibility implementation process.

Following the Orange guidelines (Design for digital platforms Guideline), available on the [Orange brand site](http://design.orange.com/) is a prerequisite to the use of this base criteria.
Some elements already present in the Orange Brand (such as the use of colours) have not been included in this list of criteria.

Two versions are available:
- **Android version** focused on the development of applications for the Google platform, Android.
- **iOS version** focused on the development of applications for the Apple platform, iOS.
