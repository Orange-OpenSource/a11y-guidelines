## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10229?time=40)

Introduced during the `2023 Platforms State of the Union` [session](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/102/?time=1532), the brand new **TipKit** framework is going to be of a great help for making users **find out some new features of an app** across all platforms.

## [Design](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10229/?time=135)
Before defining a tip, it's important to know what should be highlighted and what's definitely to be prohibited.

## Creation
Relied on the **[TipsCenter](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10229/?time=179)** that enables key `TipKit` functionality, the [tip&nbsp;creation](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10229/?time=198) is based on a **specific type** that sets the content and the conditions for when it displays.

There are [two&nbsp;types](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10229/?time=253) of tip views whose usage will depend on the purpose.

## [Rules](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10229/?time=329)
The eligibility rules for specifying **who should see the tip** are twofold.

It's also possible to [define&nbsp;a&nbsp;rule](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10229/?time=492) based on custom types to query for events based on a unique view identifier a person is currently in with some added constraints to filter the results.

## [Display](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10229/?time=558)
Control the frequency of educational messaging in an app may be handled by `TipsCenter` or directly by the tip itself through a [computed&nbsp;property](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10229/?time=633) for overriding frequency.

</br>

## [Dismissal](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10229/?time=657)
`TipKit` provides built-in methods for tips to be dismissed through a **performed action** or a **max number of appearances** for instance.

</br>

## [Tests](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10229/?time=755)
Overriding the created rules is a great way for testing thanks to some **`API` calls** that can also be used as **launch arguments** in some project's schemes for instance.
