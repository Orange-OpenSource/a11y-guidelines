# WWDC 2023: Generalize APIs with parameter packs
Find hereafter a detailed summary of a video that belongs to a [taxonomy&nbsp;of&nbsp;some&nbsp;WWDC&nbsp;footages](../../).

The original video is available on the **Apple official website** ([session&nbsp;10168](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10168/)).

"Swift parameter packs are a powerful tool to expand what is possible in your generic code while also enabling you to simplify common generic patterns. We'll show you how to **abstract over types as well as the number of arguments in generic code** and simplify common generic patterns to avoid overloads."
</br>Hereafter, the underlined elements lead directly to the playback of the WWDC video at the appropriate moment.

## [The&nbsp;origins](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10168/?time=51)

Regarding a [client&nbsp;server&nbsp;example](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10168/?time=124), the number of query arguments may be too large according to the needs.

However, this problem might be partially solved while using the [variadic&nbsp;parameters](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10168?time=136) combined with the [type&nbsp;erasure](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10168?time=172) notion that give rise to some [limitations](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10168?time=154) though.

This kind of situation is typically what **[parameter&nbsp;packs](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10168?time=237)** are for.
</br>

## [The&nbsp;fundamentals](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10168/?time=248)

'A **parameter pack** can hold any quantity of types or values and pack them together to pass them as an argument to a function.'

Handling packs at the **type-level** is a [major&nbsp;difference](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10168/?time=358) with the usual collections thanks to new ways for [writing&nbsp;code](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10168/?time=376).

![](../../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc23-10168_5.png)

It comes in handy to [avoid&nbsp;boilerplate&nbsp;code](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10168/?time=513) in such situations...

...while easily tailoring the [generic&nbsp;requirements](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10168/?time=655) on packs as well.

## [Implementation](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10168/?time=732)
It's recommended the **parentheses be used** for wrapping the pattern expression when the results are embedded in a tuple.

Regarding the [initial&nbsp;example](#the-origins), if the **[input and output types need to be different](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10168/?time=871)**, the code writing may be changed to tailor the parameter pack concept while improving the [flow&nbsp;control](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10168/?time=1013) with the `do-catch` statement for **handling errors**.
