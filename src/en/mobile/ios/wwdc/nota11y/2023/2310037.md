## [New&nbsp;chart](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10037?time=19)
With [strong&nbsp;arguments](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10037?time=46) regarding its usage, the **pie chart** joins the `Swift`&nbsp;`Charts` family along with the new **[SectorMark&nbsp;type](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10037?time=66)**.

Through the [polar&nbsp;space](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10037?time=87), a pie chart can turn into a **donut chart** for an original rendering.

[Few&nbsp;lines&nbsp;of&nbsp;code](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10037?time=106) are necessary to convert a simple chart into a basic pie chart.

And the way to get a **[donut&nbsp;chart](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10037?time=207)** is just as simple as the implemented modifications hereabove.

## [Selection](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10037?time=259)
To render a popover on top of a selection indicator, follow the milestones hereafter by keeping in mind that the `chartOverlay` modifier is replaced by the **[chartXSelection](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10037?time=326)** modifier as an `iOS`&nbsp;`17` new feature:

1. Use the new **selection modifier** to get the X-axis raw value âŸ¹ <a alt="Click to playback the video footage." href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10037?time=347">ðŸŽ¬</a>

2. Create a **rule mark** as a selection indicator for the taken value âŸ¹ <a alt="Click to playback the video footage." href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10037?time=363">ðŸŽ¬</a>

3. Use an **annotation** for displaying the sought popover âŸ¹ <a alt="Click to playback the video footage." href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10037?time=376">ðŸŽ¬</a>

![](../../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc23-10037_6.png)

Instead of a single value, a **range can also be selected** through [dedicated&nbsp;gestures](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10037?time=427) according to the system you're working on while implementing [customed&nbsp;gestures](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10037?time=441) as well.

**Pie charts** and **donuts charts** follow the exact [same&nbsp;rules](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10037?time=452) for providing the above detailed selection.

This kind of selection is also **supported on `macOS`** using a [hover&nbsp;gesture](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10037?time=419) as default instead.

## [Scrolling](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10037?time=472)
`iOS`&nbsp;`17` has brought many enhancements for scrolling with `Swift`&nbsp;`Charts` and the example detailed in this part of the video highlights few of them through different steps:

1. **Enable scrolling** âŸ¹ <a alt="Click to playback the video footage." href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10037?time=486">ðŸŽ¬</a>

2. Plan the **range of data to be visible** on the X-axis âŸ¹ <a alt="Click to playback the video footage." href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10037?time=490">ðŸŽ¬</a>

3. **Store** the selected data to a **binding** âŸ¹ <a alt="Click to playback the video footage." href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10037?time=497">ðŸŽ¬</a>
