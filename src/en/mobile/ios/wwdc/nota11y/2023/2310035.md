# WWDC 2023: Perform accessibility audits for your app
Find hereafter a detailed summary of a video that belongs to a [taxonomy&nbsp;of&nbsp;some&nbsp;WWDC&nbsp;footages](../../).

The original video is available on the **Apple official website** ([session&nbsp;10035](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10035/)).

"Discover how you can **test your app for accessibility** with every build. Learn how to **perform automated audits** for accessibility using XCTest and find out how to **interpret the results**. We'll also share enhancements to the accessibility API that can help you **improve UI test coverage**."
</br>Hereafter, the underlined elements **lead directly to the playback of the WWDC video** at the appropriate moment.
</br>

## [Overview](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10035/?time=39)
The [Accessibility&nbsp;Inspector](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10035/?time=98) is the `Xcode` developer tool that **performs audits** and **analyzes the issues** to provide a complete list of accessiblity problems to be solved in the [sample&nbsp;app](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10035/?time=124) that will be used throughout this session.

## [Perform&nbsp;an&nbsp;audit](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10035/?time=151)
Pressing the `Run Audit` button displays a screen including a filter for showing specific types of items in the main table that will point out the issues.

Using the new **performAccessibilityAudit** method on the `XCUIApplication` is the appropriate way to [automate&nbsp;audits](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10035/?time=172) in the `UI` tests ([demo](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10035/?time=202)).
![](../../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc23-10035_3.png)
In order to continuously keep on testing despite the potential issues, it's crucial to adapt the **continueAfterFailure** instance property to the [suitable&nbsp;value](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10035/?time=278) before [launching&nbsp;the&nbsp;tests](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10035/?time=293).

## [Issues](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10035/?time=304)
The `Source Editor` displays all the issues in correspondence with the line to which it relates.

### [Report&nbsp;Navigator](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10035/?time=321)
Instead of investigating by one's own, it may be wise to involve the **Report Navigator** for getting more relevant information that provide accurate details.

### [Handling&nbsp;the&nbsp;audit&nbsp;issues](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10035/?time=362)

<ul class="nav nav-tabs" role="tablist">
    <li class="nav-item" role="presentation">
        <a class="nav-link active"
           data-bs-toggle="tab" 
           href="#A11yAudits1"
           id="A11yAudits1_tab"
           role="tab" 
           aria-selected="true">First&nbsp;issue</a>
    </li>
    <li class="nav-item" role="presentation">
        <a class="nav-link"
           data-bs-toggle="tab" 
           href="#A11yAudits2"
           id="A11yAudits2_tab"
           role="tab" 
           aria-selected="false">Second&nbsp;issue</a>
    </li>
    </ul>

<div class="tab-content">
<div class="tab-pane show active" id="A11yAudits1" role="tabpanel">

<a alt="Click to playback the footage at the appropriate moment regarding the first reported issue" href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10035/?time=408">ðŸŽ¬</a>

This issue describes the way `VoiceOver` executes its vocalization (the label first and next the value) and highlights the importance of the **[accessibility&nbsp;identifier](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10035/?time=461)** in the `UI` test process.

<div class="tab-pane" id="A11yAudits2" role="tabpanel">

<a alt="Click to playback the footage at the appropriate moment regarding the second reported issue" href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10035/?time=493">ðŸŽ¬</a>

Pointing out the uselessness of a description for a decorative image, this second issue shows how to put aside an element of the accessibility area.

### [Filtered&nbsp;issues](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10035/?time=574)
In order to **set aside some false-positive issues**, the `performAccessibilityAudit` method comes in handy with its two incoming parameters: the [first&nbsp;one](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10035/?time=602) filters the types to be audited and the [second&nbsp;one](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10035/?time=625) defines the way to be executed through a closure.

## [Automation&nbsp;elements](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2023/10035/?time=787)
Following the same rationale as the `accessibilityElements`, the **automationElements** property defines an array of the elements in the container to be part of the automation.

This new instance property turns out to be efficient when it becomes important to expose elements for automation but not for accessibility and vice versa.
