# List of the WWDC detailed summaries

This section regroups [presentations at the WWDC](https://developer.apple.com/videos/all-videos/) that aren't directly [bound to accessibility](../).

Each one of them is detailed with time references to their different contents.

Most of the illustrations are parts of the Apple presentations and may be available at the `Resources` section inside the `Overview` sheet of each video.

The videos that may be of interest to designers are highlighted with a dedicated mark at the end of their names.
