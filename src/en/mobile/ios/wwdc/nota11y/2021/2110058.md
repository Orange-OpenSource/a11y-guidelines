# WWDC 2021: Meet AsyncSequence
Find hereafter a detailed summary of four videos that belong to a [taxonomy&nbsp;of&nbsp;some&nbsp;WWDC&nbsp;footages](../../).

The original videos is available on the **official Apple website** ([session&nbsp;10058](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10058/)).

"Iterating over a sequence of values over time is now as easy as writing a ‚Äúfor‚Äù loop. Find out how the **new AsyncSequence protocol** enables a natural, simple syntax for **iterating over anything** from notifications to bytes being streamed from a server. We'll also show you how to adapt existing code to **provide asynchronous sequences of your own**."

## Introduction
[AsyncSequence](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10058/?time=142) suspends on each element and receives values asynchronously while completing with success or stopping when an error is thrown.

This [asynchronous&nbsp;behavior](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10058/?time=198) comes from an usual sequence whose iterator process is altered by the compiler with the new ` async/await` syntax commonly used in Swift concurrency.

The `break` and `continue` keywords [also&nbsp;work](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10058/?time=284) in async sequences.

[Cancelling&nbsp;an&nbsp;iteration](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10058/?time=402) may also be scheduled when desired by wrapping it in a `Task`.

## APIs

Some new AsyncSequence APIs have been introduced to point out the simplicity of their implementation in different areas:

- **File**: the combination of the `lines` property with the `bytes` property of FileHandle provides a nice asynchronous reading of bytes‚üπ&nbsp;<a alt="Click to playback the footage at the appropriate time" href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10058/?time=475">üé¨</a>
![](../../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc21-10058-APIs_1.png)

- **URL**: contents of a URL can be easily returned thanks to the `lines` property‚üπ&nbsp;<a alt="Click to playback the footage at the appropriate time" href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10058/?time=508">üé¨</a>
![](../../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc21-10058-APIs_2.png)

- **URLSession**: using an async sequence with the **new bytes function** is a quick way to get bytes in  networking‚üπ&nbsp;<a alt="Click to playback the footage at the appropriate time" href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10058/?time=529">üé¨</a>
![](../../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc21-10058-APIs_3.png)

- **Notification**: the NotificationCenter can also be implied in Swift Concurrency for awaiting notifications ‚üπ&nbsp;<a alt="Click to playback the footage at the appropriate time" href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10058/?time=555">üé¨</a>
![](../../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc21-10058-APIs_4.png)

[Many&nbsp;methods](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10058/?time=587) applied on Sequence have now an **asynchronous counterpart** for working **with AsyncSequence**.
Thus, they can be used to turn a complexed logic into an easier one so as to get values from async sequences.

</br>

## [Adopting&nbsp;AsyncSequence](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10058/?time=628)
**AsyncStream** is the easiest way to **create one's own asynchronous sequences** for callbacks that are called multiple times and some delegates that both are [good&nbsp;candidates](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10058/?time=780) for async sequences.

![](../../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc21-10058-AdoptAsyncSeq_1.png)

[Customizing](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10058/?time=670) an async sequence is facilitated by the **functions and variables of the continuation structure**.

![](../../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc21-10058-AdoptAsyncSeq_2.png)

The `for-await-in` syntax provides a [significant&nbsp;flexibility](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10058/?time=751) regarding the async sequences created thanks to the Asyncstream generic type.

![](../../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc21-10058-AdoptAsyncSeq_3.png)
</br>

## [Example](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/10058/?time=36)

An example of async sequence of lines is introduced to point out the **responsiveness** when each line is received while showing off the possible use of **regular sequences** with the `async/await` syntax.
