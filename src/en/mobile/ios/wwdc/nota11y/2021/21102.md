## [Xcode&nbsp;Cloud](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=167)
This **new&nbsp;tool** deeply bound to Xcode and hosted in the cloud aims at supporting development for **all&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;platforms** including continuous integration and delivery service.

![](../../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc21-102-XcodeCloud_1.png)
</br>[Get started](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=262) with Xcode&nbsp;Cloud in four steps:
- Select the product.
    
- Confirm the workflow.
    
- Grant acces to the source code.

- Link with App Store Connect. 
    
</br>Many improvements for the [Tests](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=487) are highlighted thanks to a [demo](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=530).
</br>The [delivery process](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=842) becomes easier... 
![](../../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc21-102-XcodeCloud_2.png)
... and [crash logs](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=892) are rapidly shown up in the Xcode&nbsp;Organizer.

## [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=1119)
The modern [async/await pattern](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=1283) is now built into Swift... 
![](../../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc21-102-Swift_1.png)
<br>... adding a [structured concurrency](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=1388) with its [safe model](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=1452) including the new [actors](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=1476) objects and the [@MainActor](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=1581) annotation.

## [SwitUI](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=1766)
Many [enhancements](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=1808) have been provided to SwiftUI not to mention [accessibility](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=1862).

[Swift&nbsp;Playgrounds&nbsp;4](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=2054) is the tool to create apps on Ipad, submit them directly to the App Store while bringing this work seamlessly to Xcode.
<br><br>
## [Augmented&nbsp;Reality](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=2355) 
![](../../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc21-102-AugmentedReality_1.png)
Apple has brought [RealityKit&nbsp;2](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=2393) that enables to [make&nbsp;a&nbsp;3D&nbsp;model&nbsp;in&nbsp;minutes](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=2444) ⟹ [demo](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=2572) 

![](../../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc21-102-AugmentedReality_2.png)

A [unified&nbsp;Apple&nbsp;graphics&nbsp;platform](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=2730) with a common architecture based on Metal has been created increasing performance and power efficiency. 
![](../../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc21-102-AugmentedReality_3.png)

Xcode&nbsp;13 adds powerful new graphics developer tools in order to debug efficiently the GPU code (click on the images below to get the corresponding playback):

## [Focus](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=3113)
[Notifications](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=3128) now use one of the four interruption levels that may be linked to the [brand&nbsp;new&nbsp;summary](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=3240) that can be customized by the user.
<br><br>
## [Screen&nbsp;Time](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=3471) 
![](../../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc21-102-ScreenTime.png)
Three new Swift frameworks have been devised in the iOS SDK to enhance the parental controls:
- [Managed&nbsp;Settings&nbsp;framework](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=3583)
- [Family&nbsp;Controls&nbsp;framework](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=3621)
- [Device&nbsp;Activity&nbsp;framewok](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=3652) 
<br><br>
## [Widgets](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=3735)
Widgets have now a [new&nbsp;extra-large&nbsp;size](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=3808) that has been made for taking advantage of the entire width of the screen. 
![](../../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc21-102-Widgets.png)
Moreover, [Smart Stacks](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=3836) are introduced to place multiple widgets on top of each other.

[Widget&nbsp;Suggestions](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=3864) is a good way to add dynamically a widget in the stack according to the app it belongs is used.
<br><br>
## [Shareplay](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=3950)
[Shareplay](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=3989) is the new way to share activities with a group of friends on the device: **group** and **activity** are the most two important concepts in this feature ⟹ [demo](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=4112) to use the Group Activities in a media app for developers. 
![](../../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc21-102-Shareplay_1.png)
`Shareplay` is a perfect mean to interact with people in the group [using&nbsp;the&nbsp;same&nbsp;interface](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2021/102/?time=4252) with a complete synchronization.
