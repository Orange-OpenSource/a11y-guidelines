# WWDC 2022: Track down hangs with Xcode and on-device detection
Find hereafter a detailed summary of four videos that belong to a [taxonomy&nbsp;of&nbsp;some&nbsp;WWDC&nbsp;footages](../../).

The original videos are available on the **Apple official website** ([session&nbsp;10082](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10082/)).

"Learn how you can **increase responsiveness** and **eliminate hangs** in your app and make even better experiences. Hang out with the **Performance Tools** team as we explore how you can track down these issues â€” and even stop them from occurring in the first place.
We'll take you through the latest detection mechanisms for iOS to help **track hangs during pre-release testing**, show you how to **identify issues in release builds** using the **Xcode Organizer**, and more."

</br>Most of the illustrations are parts of the Apple presentations and may be available at the `Resources` section inside the `Overview` sheet of each video.
</br>Hereafter, the underlined elements lead directly to the playback of the WWDC video at the appropriate moment.

The **three phases** of the [app-development&nbsp;process](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10082/?time=153)...

... now contain new tools to detect and report hangs:
- [MetricKit](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10082/?time=195)
- [Xcode&nbsp;Metric&nbsp;Organizer](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10082/?time=206)
- [Thread&nbsp;Performance&nbsp;Checker](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10082/?time=235)
- [Hang&nbsp;Detection](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10082/?time=244)
- [On-device&nbsp;Hang&nbsp;Detection](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10082/?time=250)
- [Hang&nbsp;Reports](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10082/?time=264)

</br>
Some of them are partially explained and detailed in the following sections reflecting the three aforementioned phases.
</br></br>

## Development
![](../../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc22-10082-5.png)
### [Thread&nbsp;Performance&nbsp;Checker](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10082/?time=283)
This tool notifies in the `Xcode`&nbsp;`Issue`&nbsp;`Navigator` when it detects **priority inversions** or **non-UI work** on the **app main thread**.

### [Time&nbsp;Profiler](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10082/?time=356)
This tool **detects hangs** and labels them directly in the corresponding **process track**.
![](../../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc22-10082-4.png)
This new feature enables to highlight the **[main&nbsp;thread&nbsp;unresponsiveness](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10082/?time=431)** awaiting for another thread return.
</br>
### [Hang&nbsp;tracing](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10082/?time=486)
This instrument may be used to **configure a hang duration threshold** in order to find specific periods of unresponsiveness.
</br>
## [Beta](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10082/?time=519)
The **[on-device&nbsp;hang&nbsp;detection](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10082/?time=540)** is used for development-signed or TestFlight apps, and **notifies hangs** in real time while supporting diagnostics by providing the main steps with no specific details.

The **[tailspin](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10082/?time=670)** in `Instruments` may be of a great interest if a more advanced study of the diagnostic is necessary.
</br>
## [Public&nbsp;release](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10082/?time=742)

`Xcode`&nbsp;`14` supports [hangs&nbsp;reports](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10082/?time=755) directly from the users devices.

Monitoring the power and performance metrics goes with a new **notifications alert button** to be informed of an important and unexpected [hangs&nbsp;rate](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10082/?time=894).
![](../../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc22-10082-8.png)

Adding **[symbolication](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10082/?time=922)** to the app will be of a great assistance when decoding and understanding all the messages will be topical.
