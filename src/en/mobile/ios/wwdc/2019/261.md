# WWDC 2019 : Large Content Viewer

This video available on the **official Apple website** ([session 261](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/261/)) aims at highlighting the new iOS 13 features dealing with the **Large Content Viewer** implemented with the Dynamic Type accordingly since iOS 11.

<br><br>Various contents and their video timelapse are indicated hereunder:

- [Dynamic Type](#dynamic-type-0057) (00:57)

- [Large Content Viewer](#large-content-viewer-0154) (01:54)

- [Image settings](#image-settings-0402) (04:02)

- [Custom Views](#custom-views-0452) (04:52) ‚üπ **iOS 13 new feature**

- [Examples](#examples-0915) (09:15)


Thereafter, according to the presentation configuration, the selection of a title or a timelapse will give rise to the video playback on the Apple website directly at the appropriate moment.
<br><br>
## [Dynamic Type (00:57)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/261/?time=57)
Reminder on the Dynamic Type feature whose goal is to **customize the text size** thanks to the user settings.
![](../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc19-261-DynamicType.png)
<br>The [iOS&nbsp;developers&nbsp;guide&nbsp;section](../../../development/#text-size) of this site contains many useful information about the implementation of this feature.
<br><br>
## [Large Content Viewer (01:54)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/261/?time=114)
This feature introduced in iOS 11 and **available only for the accessibility text sizes** allows people with low vision to use UIKit bar elements as effective as the Dynamic Type grows the text size.
![](../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc19-261-LargeContentViewer_1.png)
<br>To trigger this functionnality, the user must **long press** the element to see a larger version, **drag his finger along the bottom bar** to find out all the bar items and let it go to activate the proper one.

<br>It's important to notice that **'scaling with Dynamic Type is always preferred to showing the Large Content Viewer'** that must be implemented **'only for the case when your custom UI cannot grow in size'**.
<br><br>
## [Image settings (04:02)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/261/?time=242)
In this part of the video, all the image characteristics are reviewed to get as smooth and detailed a rendering as possible when the image is getting larger, as indicated in the [iOS&nbsp;developers&nbsp;guide&nbsp;section](../../../development/#graphical-elements-size).
<br>The Xcode Interface Builder can be associated to some lines of code for this purpose:

<br><br>
## [Custom Views (04:52)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/261/?time=292)
When implementing the Dynamic Type feature, **iOS 13** allows to **show the same UI that's shown for standard UIKit bar items**.
![](../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc19-261-CustomViews_1.png)
<br>The **`UILargeContentViewerItem` protocol** (<a alt="Click to playback the video at the indicated time." href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/261/?time=335">05:35</a>) defines the needed information for the large content viewer and is **already implemented by the UIView class** that provides setters as well (no need to subclass and override):
![](../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc19-261-CustomViews_2.png)
<br>A gesture interaction must also be added (<a alt="Click to playback the video at the indicated time." href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/261/?time=412">06:52</a>) to finalize the large content viewer implementation:
![](../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc19-261-CustomViews_3.png)
<br>Some properties are also bound to this interaction (<a alt="Click to playback the video at the indicated time." href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/261/?time=431">07:11</a>) to get and/or define more details:
![](../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc19-261-CustomViews_4.png)
<br>Finally, the delegate of the gesture interaction contains some specific options (<a alt="Click to playback the video at the indicated time." href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/261/?time=472">07:52</a>) to provide custom actions:
![](../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc19-261-CustomViews_5.png)
<br><br>
## [Examples (09:15)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/261/?time=555)
The first example deals with **standard UIKit views**.
![](../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc19-261-Examples_1.png)
<br>The second example takes into account **custom classes for some buttons** (<a alt="Click to playback the video at the indicated time." href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/261/?time=593">09:53</a>) whose properties must be overriden to be well defined.
![](../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc19-261-Examples_2.png)
<br>The last example tackles a **button with an already existing long press action** (<a alt="Click to playback the video at the indicated time." href="https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2019/261/?time=636">10:36</a>).
