<br>During this presentation, the following solutions for accessibility development pitfalls are suggested thanks to a simple application ([take a look at it](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/215/?time=1007)):

- How to define an (in)accessible element? [(31:10)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/215/?time=1870)

- How to fill the `label` and `value` properties? [(29:59)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/215/?time=1799)

- How to gather several elements into a single one? [(31:50)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/215/?time=1910)

<br>Thereafter, the selection of a title will give rise to the video playback directly at the proper moment.
<br><br>
## [Text detection in image (07:07)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/215/?time=427)
It's now possible to find out if some **text is incrusted inside an image**.

![](../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc17-215-ImageTextDetection.png)
<br>This basic detection that can be done thanks to a **simple tap with 3 fingers** will vocalize the text to someone who 
can't initially read it.
<br><br>
## [Improved photo description (08:01)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/215/?time=481)
The **vocalization of a photo description** is a new Voice Over feature that is fired thanks to a **simple tap with 3 fingers**.

![](../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc17-215-ImprovedPhotoDescription.png)
<br>A very simple detection of the context, the faces and their expressions is then vocalized to a visual impaired user.
<br><br>
## [Type to SIRI (11:37)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/215/?time=697)
Very usefull feature for people who **can't use SIRI vocally** or who are willing to **make some requests in a discreet way**.
<br>To enable this feature, go to `Accessibility` in the `Settings` to make the activation effective.

![](../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc17-215-TypeToSiri.png)
<br><br>
## [Accessibility Inspector (15:35)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/215/?time=935)
In this part, the Xcode accessibility inspector instrument is used to show basics about an accessibility app audit.
<br>Examples are provided without explaining in depth the tool itself to which a former Apple session ([2016 - 407](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/407/)) is dedicated.
<br><br>
## [UIAccessibilityProtocol (21:14)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/215/?time=1274)
Reminder on the `UIAccessibility` informal protocol fundamentals that will be used during the presentation.

<br><br>
## [Attributed Accessibility Properties (26:07)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/215/?time=1567)
`NSAttributedString` can be used in order to customize the way to vocalize the `label`, `value` and `hint` accessibility properties.

![](../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc17-215-AttributedStrings.png)
<br>Among the provided examples, one deals with the vocalization of a specific element in a foreign language.

![](../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc17-215-AttributedStringsExample.png)
<br>All usable keys can be found on the [Apple official documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/accessibility/uiaccessibility/speech_attributes_for_attributed_strings).
<br><br>
## [Accessibility Container Type (27:20)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/215/?time=1640)
A new accessibility **typed container** is available in **iOS 11**.

![](../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc17-215-ContainerType.png)
<br>The notion of container already existed in iOS but VoiceOver couldn't know the kind of container until now.
<br><br>
## [Custom actions (35:43)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/215/?time=2143)
**Many different actions may be attributed** to an element thanks to a bunch of `accessibilityCustomAction`.

![](../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc17-215-CustomActions.png)
<br>As soon as this element is selected, a **vertical swipe with one finger** will be proposing the choices of possible actions.
<br>The programming implementation of this feature is detailed in the [development part](../../../development#custom-actions).
<br><br>
## [Default activation (37:38)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/215/?time=2258)
In order to limit or make them easier all the user VoiceOver handlings, it's possible to trigger appropriate actions as soon as an element is activated thanks to a double tap.

![](../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc17-215-DefaultAction.png)
<br><br>
## [Adjustable (38:22)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/215/?time=2302)
When you want to **change the value** provided by elements such as `slider` or `picker` in a **very fluid way**, two methods have to be implemented:

![](../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc17-215-AdjustableValues.png)
<br>As soon as the view is selected, a **vertical swipe with one finger** increases (up) or shrinks (down) the value.
<br>The programming implementation of this feature is detailed in the [development part](../../../development#continuous-adjustable-values).
<br><br>
## [Pass through (39:40)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/215/?time=2380)
If a VoiceOver user **double taps with one finger, holds it** and passes it through the panning gesture, a finer adjustment of a slider can be obtained.

![](../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc17-215-PassThrough_1.png)
<br>The [accessibilityActivationPoint](../../../development#modify-the-focus-area-of-voiceover) attribute will allow a fine location in the panning gesture.

![](../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc17-215-PassThrough_2.png)
<br><br>
## [Custom scrolling (41:02)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/215/?time=2462)
The VoiceOver basic scrolling is based on a **3 fingers swipe** but it can be customized thanks to the `accessibilityScroll` method belonging to the `UIAccessibilityAction` protocol.

![](../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc17-215-CustomScrolling.png)
<br><br>
## [Drag & Drop (42:54)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/215/?time=2574)
This new feature isn't explained in depth but only its 2 overriding principles are presented: the drag sources and the drop points.

![](../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc17-215-DragAndDrop.png)
<br>Their use is briefly described in an [example](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2017/215/?time=2729) at the end of the video.
