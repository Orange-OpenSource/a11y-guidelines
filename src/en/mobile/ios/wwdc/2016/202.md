- **Example**&nbsp;: during this presentation, the hereunder solutions for VoiceOver development pitfalls are suggested thanks to a simple application that's highly recommended [to&nbsp;be&nbsp;watched](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/202/?time=699) before going further.
Once implemented, these solutions give rise to an application whose VoiceOver efficiency is shown in a [live&nbsp;demonstration](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/202/?time=1759).

    - Activate a `table view cell` [(19:58)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/202/?time=1198).
    
    - Put a dynamic `label` on a button [(20:21)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/202/?time=1221).
    
    - Make `CALayer` elements accessible (used to create a graph for instance) [(20:45)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/202/?time=1245).
    
    - Understand the navigation problems on a `mapview` with VoiceOver [(23:33)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/202/?time=1413).
    
    - Searching elements in a `table view` [(25:37)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/202/?time=1537) and in a `mapview` [(27:45)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/202/?time=1665) thanks to the `rotor` item.

<br>Thereafter, the selection of a title will give rise to the video playback directly at the proper moment.
<br><br>
## [MOTOR - Switch Control (02:29)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/202/?time=149)
After a brief reminder about this iOS functionality, a specific focus is invoked in this **new tvOS feature**.

<br><br>
## [MOTOR - Dwell Control (03:36)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/202/?time=216)
Connected remote devices allow a user to control their mouse.
<br>When the mouse dwells on a location, the Dwell Control feature displays a timer at the expiration of which an action is triggered (new&nbsp;MacOS&nbsp;feature).

<br><br>
## [VISION - Display adjustments (04:15)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/202/?time=255)
People who are light sensitive or have color issues already use the MacOS and iOS supported features (inverted colors...) that are now **available for tvOS**.
<br><br>
## [VISION - Taptic time (04:53)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/202/?time=293)
Introduced in **WatchOS 3**, this new VoiceOver feature includes a **series of distinct taps** to help people tell time silently and discretely.
<br><br>
## [VISION - Magnifier (05:17)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/202/?time=317)
This **new iOS 10 feature** allows the device's camera to be used in order to magnify the user environment with many possible functionalities (steadiness, zoom, color filters...) whose efficiency is shown in a [live&nbsp;demonstration](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/202/?time=344).
<br><br>
## [HEARING - TTY (06:51)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/202/?time=411)
The typewriter technology that allows to hold text conversations over standard telephone calls for someone with hearing loss is now **available for iOS**.
<br>This **new iOS 10 feature** is a software implementation that prevents from adding any additional TTY hardware while using this technology only with an iOS device. 
<br><br>
## [LEARNING - Enhanced typing feedback (07:51)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/202/?time=471)
Besides the improvements for `Speech Selection` and `Speech Screen` in the `Accessibility - Speech` part, an audio typing feedback has also been implemented.
<br>This **new iOS 10 feature** helps people with dyslexia to catch and prevent mistakes in their writings, highlighted by a [live&nbsp;demonstration](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/202/?time=496).
<br><br>
## [UIAccessibilityProtocol (14:19)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/202/?time=859)
Reminder on the `UIAccessibility` informal protocol fundamentals that will be used during the presentation.

<br><br>
## [accessibilityElements (18:00)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/202/?time=1080)
The implementation and the purpose of this element are explained and introduced inside the demo application.

![](../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc16-202-accessibilityElements.png)
<br><br>
## [accessibilityFrameInContainerSpace (19:02)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/202/?time=1142)
This **new iOS 10 feature** allows the automatic handling of the accessible element coordinates inside its `container`.

<br><br>
## [accessibilityCustomRotors (24:19)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/202/?time=1459)
Customed elements can be added to a native `rotor` thanks to this **new iOS 10 feature**.

![](../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc16-202-accessibilityCustomRotors.png)
<br>The programming implementation of this feature is detailed in the [development&nbsp;part](../../../development#custom-rotor).
<br><br>
## [tvOS header elements (31:20)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/202/?time=1880)
This last section deals with reminders of header elements implementation and purpose inside a VoiceOVer navigation with tvOS.
