# WWDC 2016 : Auditing Your Apps for Accessibility 

This video available on the **official Apple website** ([session 407](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/407/)) aims at defining and using the `Accessibility`&nbsp;`Inspector` tool of Xcode, based on good practice implementation.

<br><br>Various contents and their video timelapse are indicated hereunder:

- [Accessibility&nbsp;Inspector](#accessibility-inspector-0938) (09:38)

- [Audit](#audit-1121) (11:21)

- [Inspection](#inspection-2030) (20:30)

- [Settings](#settings-2833) (28:33)

<br>At the end of this presentation, it's highly recommended to take a look at the [Accessibilty&nbsp;Inspector new&nbsp;features](../../2019/#accessibility-inspector) introduced in Xcode&nbsp;11 so as to be as up to date as possible.
<br><br>Thereafter, the selection of a title will give rise to the video playback on the Apple website directly at the proper moment.

## [Accessibility&nbsp;Inspector (09:38)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/407/?time=578)
Overview of the tool pointing out the themes to be developed : audit, inspection and settings.

## [Audit (11:21)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/407/?time=681)
This part contains a demo [(12:22)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/407/?time=742) that highlights the way to find out a solution for the problem detected by the tool [(14:24)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/407/?time=864) while providing a bug report [(17:07)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/407/?time=1027).

<br>A complementary **manual audit** is also **mandatory** to avoid bypassing some kind of hidden problems [(18:55)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/407/?time=1135).
<br><br>
## [Inspection (20:30)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/407/?time=1230)
This feature explanation is build on an example [(21:58)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/407/?time=1318) that points out possible kinds of problems in an app like:
- Inappropriate sequencing of elements during the navigation. [(23:11)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/407/?time=1391)

- Abstruse description of an element. [(23:34)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/407/?time=1414)

- Improper action of an element. [(24:02)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/407/?time=1442)

The presentation of the view hierarchy of this feature [(24:40)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/407/?time=1480) comes along with an important point dealing with CALayer elements that aren't taken into account by VoiceOver.

## [Settings (28:33)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/407/?time=1713)
Last but not least, this feature (highlighted thanks to a demo - [30:25](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2016/407/?time=1825)) avoids switching back and forth between changing some accessibility settings and verifying the result on the app.
