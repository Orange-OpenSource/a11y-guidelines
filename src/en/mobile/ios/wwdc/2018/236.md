# WWDC 2018 : Making iOS talk with AVSpeechSynthesizer

This video available on the **official Apple website** ([session 236](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/236/)) aims at highlighting the essential elements to be implemented in order to **use a synthesized speech thanks to AVSpeechSynthesizer**.

## [Uses (00:48)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/236/?time=48)
The wide range of possible use cases offered by this feature are introduced in this section.
<br><br>
## [Basics (02:03)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/236/?time=123)
Using a synthesized speech first implies a **`AVSpeechSynthesizer` instance creation** that must be retained until the speech is done.

<br>Then **create an utterance** that must be provided to the previous instance.
![](../../../../images/iOSdev/wwdc18-236-Basics_2.png)
<br>In this case, an audio session is automatically activated and may be used together with the speech synthesis.

<br>This session must be explicitly deactivated after speech is done.
<br><br>
## [AVSpeechSynthesizerDelegate (03:20)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/236/?time=200)
This protocol encompasses many **optional methods that handle speech synthesis events**:

- Pauses and resumes.

- Starts and ends of the `AVSpeechUtterance` instances.

- Spoken character range.

<br><br>
## [Demo (04:11)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/236/?time=251)
Simple example of a speech synthesis highlighted thanks to the `AVSpeechSynthesizerDelegate` protocol methods.

<br><br>
## [Choosing the right voice (04:31)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/236/?time=271)
The default voice is the built-in voice of the device supported language.

<br>However, it's still possible to select another voice specifying the desired language or using an identifier inside an array of speech voices that have been downloaded.

<br><br>
## [Speech rate (05:32)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/236/?time=332)
The speech rate can be changed thanks to the rate property going from 0 to 1.

<br><br>
## [Pitch and volume (06:15)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/236/?time=375)
The pitch tone and the speech volume can be easily modified without affecting the system volume.

<br><br>
## [Phonetics (06:54)](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2018/236/?time=414)
The <abbr>IPA</abbr> can be used with **Attributed Strings** in order to customize how specialized names, words or sentences are pronounced.

<br>Attributed strings may also be used to specify a different language for a part of a sentence for instance.
