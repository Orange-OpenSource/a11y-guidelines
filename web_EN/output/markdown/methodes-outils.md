When developing or redesigning sites or applications, accessibility must be evaluated early and throughout the project cycle process to identify accessibility problems early, when it is easier to address them.  

Digital accessibility evaluation within Orange is performed with 3 types of testing:

- **Technical evaluation** consists in checking code and colors contrast in order to verify compliance against the criteria of the international standard <abbr>WCAG</abbr> 2.1 level AA.
- **Functional evaluation** verifies the application works with <abbr>assistive technologies</abbr> and there are no blocking defects.
- **User evaluation** evaluates the application by participants with disabilities watching for potential barriers related to accessibility when they complete tasks using their assistive technologies.

## Technical evaluation
There are different tools for automatic accessibility testing that help ensure that the web content meets the required standards. However most criteria require human evaluation. These tests are performed within project teams, though manual testing is mostly realized by accessibility experts.

Examples of tools:
- [Perform automated tests on a page](./methodes-outils-extensions.html): browser extensions.
- [Measure the colour contrast level](./methodes-outils-contrastes.html): introducing the "Colour Contrast Analyser" tool.

## Functional evaluation

These tests are usually performed by accessibility experts but can also be realized by projects actors trained to assistive technologies.  

Examples of testing:
- [Keyboard navigation](./methodes-outils-clavier.html): main shorcuts to navigate web pages with keyboard alone.
- [Text size enlargement](./methodes-outils-zoom.html): zoom guide.
- [Navigating with screen reader](./methodes-outils-lecteur-ecran.html): screen readers commonly used.

## User evaluation

These tests are performed once the technical and functional tests have confirmed a good level of accessibility. Participants will use their usual environment and assistive technologies to realize the main tasks of the product or service to be tested. Focus on accessibility issues, these tests aim at raising usage problems and assessing the critical importance of remaining problems.  

These tests are managed by accessibility experts.
