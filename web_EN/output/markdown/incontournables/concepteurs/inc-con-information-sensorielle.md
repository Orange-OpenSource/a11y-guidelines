**Target: ** everyone, especially the colour-blind and more generally people with visual impairments, cognitive limitations, hearing impairments and elderly people.  
**When: ** as of design and during development.

**Description: **  
Do not use colour or sensory characteristics (shape, size, sound, direction, visual localization…) as the only way of conveying information, indicating an action, requesting a response or distinguishing an element. The information provided by a colour change or a sensory characteristic must be completed with textual information (alternative) or / and semantic structuring.

**Do: **

**Don’t: **

This example is not valid because the information is conveyed only by colour.

**Checklist: **
- Take a screenshot and convert it in black and white. The loss of colour should not cause difficulty while navigating, nor cause loss of information.
- Turn off the speakers, the level of information should remain the same.
