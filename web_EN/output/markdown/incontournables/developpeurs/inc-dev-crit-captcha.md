**Description: **
Captchas are often the source of difficulties for users. If the implementation of an anti-spam system can not be avoided, it is advisable to move towards a more flexible solution for the user & nbsp ;:

- Double authentication
- Hidden form field to leave blank (honeypot technique), not visible to the user
- Providing phone support to ensure that the customer is a real person
- A check to ensure that the same <abbr>IP</abbr>/User agent combination does not attempt to submit the form more than N times per second.

If no other alternative is possible, it is essential to provide an alternative for captcha only visual or sound by proposing a combination of captcha types: an audio + visual captcha, logical tests (question whose answer is obvious, mathematical test simple ...) + classic visual captchaâ€¦
