**Target: **everyone, especially people with visual impairments.  
**When: **during development.

**Description: **

Follow general recommendations for accessibility, use primarily the <abbr>HTML</abbr> standard components, otherwise, use the <abbr>ARIA</abbr> (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) interface for complex components.


**Checklist: **

Ensure there is no blocking point with a browser/screen reader combination (Firefox/NVDA, IE/Jaws, Safari/VoiceOver) when a user navigates (accessing the main features of the application).
Indeed, screen reader users are the most affected by the lack of accessibility, we can identify a huge amount of problems in satisfying this requirement.

**Usersâ€™ goal: **

Allow the screen reader users to access the main features of the application, but also ensure the usability of the application for all users.
