## Web accessibility definition
** An accessible web service can be used by anyone: **

- A valid person,
- elderly people,
- people with disabilities (temporary or permanent).

** and in all situations: **

- with any kind of material: web browser, PC, MAC, mobile phones, tablet;
- in an unfavourable environment: poor luminosity, touchpad while moving, etc.;
- with specific software that compensates a disability.
