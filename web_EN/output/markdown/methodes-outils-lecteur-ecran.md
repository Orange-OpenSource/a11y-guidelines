A screen reader is a voice synthesis software used by the visually impaired and the blind. It allows the user to interact with the computer and listen to what is displayed as text (usually) on the screen.
There are several screen readers, the most prevalent are:
- [NVDA](http://nvda-fr.org/): free, available for Windows.
- [Jaws](http://www.freedomscientific.com/Downloads/JAWS): commercial, available for Windows. In trial mode, you can only use it for 40 minutes, but if you restart your computer you can use it again.
- [VoiceOver](http://www.apple.com/fr/accessibility/osx/voiceover/): free, available for Mac. It is directly integrated into the MacOS system.

## Getting started with NVDA

NVDA is a free screen reader available for Windows.

### Installation

Download the NVDA installer on the [official website](https://www.nvaccess.org/).

The default voice is not very good but it is very reactive. It is not mandatory, but you can [download extra voices](https://github.com/nvaccess/nvda/wiki/ExtraVoices). Then just go to preferences to change NVDA voice settings.

### Configuration

At first startup, NVDA is configured to vocalize whatever the mouse pointer is over. This mode is used by visually-impaired people who have difficulties reading the text displayed on the screen, for example. It is recommended to disable this option if you use NVDA to test accessibility on your pages.
To disable this navigation mode, right-click on the NVDA icon located in the notification area. Then go to *Preferences&nbsp;&gt; Mouse settings* and uncheck “Enable mouse tracking”.

Finally, it is advisable to change the default playback mode. On a webpage use the following keyboard shortcut <kbd>Ins + v</kbd> to disable the “screen layout is preserved” option and then save this configuration as default using the shortcut <kbd>Ins + Ctrl + c</kbd>.
