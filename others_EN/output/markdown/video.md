## Introduction
All pre-recorded videos should have a transcript attached and closed captions available, and audio description available when necessary.

## Provide a transcript 
Transcripts include the text of the words spoken in the video, and also the text of important words that appear on screen and important actions or changes of scene. It must be provided in text, HTML (to be preferred) or Word and must be immediately after the video.  

**Perimeter:** all.

## Provide captions 
Captions are a text version of the speech and sound on the video. They are displayed over the video. Captions should appear at the same time as the sound they are captioning and appear onscreen long enough to be read. Closed captions have to be preferred over open captions as they can be set on or off by the viewer while open captions are displayed to all viewers. They are mainly needed for users with hearing disabilities.  

**Perimeter:** videos, animated components.

## Provide audio descriptions when important visual information is not covered in what is said

Audio descriptions are separate audio tracks containing speech that describes the action, characters, and scenes of a video. It is played along with the video and it lets blind and vision-impaired users know whatâ€™s happening on the screen.  

Audio description is not needed for talking heads only, or for text on slides as long as the slide text is included into what is said. Audio description might be needed for components like charts and diagrams.  

**Perimeter:** videos, animated components.

## Choose an accessible media Player

- Captions and audio description supported
- On/off command for captions, audio description and setup menu
- Buttons and controls usable without a mouse and properly labeled
- Accessible to keyboard-only users and screen reader users.  

Media player must support captions, and audio descriptions. Users must be able to set these features on and off.  

Users with disabilities may use navigational devices other than a mouse, such as keyboards or screen readers. For this reason, users should be able to operate the media player without using a mouse. The player should also label its buttons and controls, so that users with screen readers can hear the name of each button and control and select the correct option.

**Perimeter:** all.  

## Do not play videos automatically when the page loads 

This can be confusing for many users, and the sound can interfere with assistive technologies such as screen readers.  

**Perimeter:** all.

## Do not use videos that have more than three flashes within a period of 1 second
This can provoke seizures in users with epilepsy.  

**Perimeter:** videos, animated components.

**All other relevant criteria such as color contrasts must also be enforced.**
