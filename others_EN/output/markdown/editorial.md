## Introduction
This section proposes general recommendations to ensure your contents are accessible whatever the medium used (email, Web, Word, etc.).

## Check colours

- Make sure colour is not the only means used to convey information.
- Make sure there is sufficient contrast between the text colour and the background.

The contrast can be checked with <a href="https://www.paciellogroup.com/resources/contrastanalyser/" hreflang="en" lang="en">Colour Contrast Analyzer</a>&nbsp;:
 - 4.5:1 for normal size text.
 - 3:1 for big text.

## Facilitate reading

- Align text to the left, don’t justify it.
- Use an easily-readable font family with a minimum size of 12 pixels.
- Use simple punctuation.
- Avoid italics, completely capitalised sentences; but always put a capital at the beginning of a sentence.
- Avoid textured backgrounds (images).
- Do not do too many repeated carriage returns or tabs to space contents (rather, use “Paragraph&nbsp;&gt; Spacing” or “Indent” in Word for instance).
- Avoid layout and data tables.
- Avoid information-conveying content in images (graphs, schemas, diagrams,…)
- Signal the end of the document (for instance, an image saying “End of email”, or a white-on-white text “End of document”).
- Use simple, clear and short phrase turns: subject, verb, complement. One idea per sentence, with simple words.
- Explain complicated words.
- Use the present tense, preferably direct style, and active form (no subjunctive, no conjunctions).
- Use proper typographic characters: dash -, em-dash —, “rounded quotes”.
<!-- removed 1 line re: accents and caps – not relevant in English --> 
- Avoid foreign words, abbreviations except those that are genuinely used.

## Provide accessible layout tables

Simplify tables, even if we know that email clients (including Outlook) still often demand to use tables for layout.

Checkpoints:

- In general, don’t do complex table layouts (merging cells, multicolumn,…).
- Avoid embedding layout tables (maximum two levels of embedding), but also:
- Don’t merge table cells, but use several simpler tables.
- Don’t keep empty cells.
- Don’t add background images.
- Make sure that the sequential order is correct (one can read left to right and top to bottom).
- Avoid complex data tables, graphs or schemas.
